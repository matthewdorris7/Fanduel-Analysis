# Fanduel-Analysis
## Sports Algorithms and Data Analysis for Fanduel (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL)

•	Imported historical sports data to Excel and created a projection system that analyzes a player based on various statistical factors.

•	Created a linear programming algorithm in VBA code using Excel Solver for the MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL that maximizes a daily lineup’s total points while under a given salary cap, adhering to the positional constraints of the league.

•	After more research and data analysis, I created an improved algorithm that “stacks” players from the same team so that there occur less independent events, which led to a higher chance of winning, and better results.

•	Capability to run algorithm to maximize points for the 30 optimal lineups
